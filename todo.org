* Nim to GLSL
** NEXT nim to glsl compiler

* stability
** TODO move openmesh to github
** TODO make submodules use https instead of git because reasons



* DSL [5/12]
** PONSTPHONED Document user code sections for afterSetup, beforeRender, afterRender
** transform feedback
*** PONSTPHONED allow non-interleaved transform feedback attributes
*** DONE transform feedback type that contains attributes at compile time
*** PONSTPHONED shadingDSl with transform feedback as source for the attributes, calls glDrawTransformfeedback(Instanced)
** PONSTPHONED unifom buffer
** PONSTPHONED tesselation shader stages
** PONSTPHONED compute shaders
** PONSTPHONED modular shader system
** PONSTPHONED forward vertex shader when only geometry shader is available
** PONSTPHONED infer primitive mode from buffer
** DONE Add user code sctions for afterSetup, beforeRender, afterRender
** CANCELED polymorphic shaders (NOT POSSILE at least not with glSubroutine)
** DONE VAO bindings should be fixed and not depending on the attibute location (allows to recompile the shader when the locations change)
** DONE In DSL move indices from attributes to named argument section
** DONE warn for unused shader uniforms/attributes

* library [6/9]

** DONE finish easy text renderer
** DONE add primitive shapes
*** DONE torus
*** DONE circle (important for portal)
*** DONE cone
*** DONE icosphere
** DONE default moveable camera
** DONE fallback error texture when loading texture from file
** DONE add support for (3D) (perlin) noise
** DONE compile time for typeinfo
** PONSTPHONED add general pupose linear algebra package (eg BLAS, Eigen, etc)
** PONSTPHONED generic texture/sampler setData
** PONSTPHONED add support for OpenMesh

* examples [1/3]

** PONSTPHONED let mrfixit use the easy text renderer
*** PONSTPHONED fix bug that text is rendered too wide with uninitialized memory
** PONSTPHONED cubical marching squares example
** DONE fix portal rendering in example

* other [1/2]

** DONE script to clear all binaries from the project
** PONSTPHONED code reloading
